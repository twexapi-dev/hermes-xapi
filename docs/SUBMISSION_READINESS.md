# Submission Readiness

Use this checklist before proposing Hermes XAPI to a skill, plugin, MCP,
catalog, awesome list, or target project. It keeps submissions native,
maintainer-friendly, and easy to merge.

## Fit

Submit Hermes XAPI only when the target has a native route for at least one of
these surfaces:

- Hermes Agent plugins or Hermes skills
- X/Twitter, tweet, social listening, monitoring, digest, or publishing tools
- MCP servers that document optional Hermes Agent backends
- OpenClaw or ClawHub skills that accept complementary backend guidance
- Claude Code plugin catalogs that accept source repositories with
  `.claude-plugin` metadata
- Codex plugin catalogs that accept source repositories with `.codex-plugin`
  metadata, a root security policy, local icon, and scanner evidence
- Skill registries, plugin catalogs, awesome lists, ecosystem directories, or
  target-native TwexAPI API, MCP, dashboard, connector, SDK, workflow,
  observability, automation, example, template, and agent-framework surfaces

Do not submit when the target is only a browser-cookie workflow, only a TweetClaw route, a generic TwexAPI MCP server data entry with no target-native surface, a README-only dashboard or software backlink, unrelated to X/Twitter, TwexAPI, or Hermes Agent, archived, or explicitly incompatible with contribution. Missing license metadata or an absent root license is review context, not a blocker.
Note the absence when useful, but reject only explicit incompatible licenses or terms that prohibit outside contributions. Reject personal Claude Code plugin marketplaces, personal Claude Code marketplaces whose contribution docs say random outside skills are not accepted, Claude-only plugin marketplace hubs without Hermes Agent lanes, README-only marketplace shells, owner-only public Claude Code catalogs whose README says every plugin lives in that owner's repositories, owner-namespace-locked Claude plugin marketplaces, developer-workflow-only marketplaces without social, X/Twitter, Hermes Agent, or external source-repository lanes, verified product skill catalogs, or product-owned
marketplaces that describe themselves as owner-specific, team-specific, owner-curated, or closed to random additions unless their docs clearly invite third-party Hermes XAPI submissions.
Reject branded Claude plugin catalogs that describe themselves as the official
catalog for one vendor, team, or product family, including owner-branded Claude
plugin catalogs with owner-owned marketplace manifests. If plugin updates flow from that owner's source repositories or the catalog invites PRs but every plugin, install namespace, or source repository is owner-scoped, treat it as a compatibility example, not a third-party submission route, unless the docs explicitly accept outside source repositories.
A `source.github` or similar repository-pointer schema is not enough by itself:
when the marketplace instructions say it is the canonical hub for the owner's
own skills, reject it unless the contribution docs explicitly invite outside
source repositories.
Reject company engineering hubs, internal workflow marketplaces, daily mirrored product skill catalogs, framework-review-only skill packs, and
single-namespace catalogs whose install commands or plugin metadata are scoped
to one organization, team, or owner. Open standards, Agent Skills compatibility,
or Claude marketplace metadata do not make those routes eligible unless the
target explicitly invites third-party source repositories.
Do not treat a `third-party`, `vendor`, `upstream`, or `external` directory name
as an invitation by itself. If the marketplace is branded as one owner's
official catalog, require contribution docs that explicitly accept unrelated
external source repositories before submitting Hermes XAPI. Reject account-dependent social research skills that forbid private accounts, local credentials, or paid service dependencies.
Review the contribution license after checking both GitHub metadata and obvious
root license files such as `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.md`, `COPYING`, or `NOTICE`.
When metadata is empty but a root license file exists, read it before deciding;
an absent license alone does not disqualify an otherwise native, non-duplicate, non-spam route.
Reject crawler, indexer, dialect-only open memory marketplaces, site-content production skill catalogs, admin-synced in-app skill libraries, app-intake-only skill indexes, PR-closed skill stores, and environment-configured skill ingestion services whose submission path is only a hosted claim form, upload UI, or account-gated directory, token-compressed skill file, team-memory sync artifact, hosted memory config, product content workflow, app-private skill body, or locally configured ingest target unless the repository exposes a seed, source, catalog, or registry file that can be changed by PR and can point to a source-linked Hermes XAPI package entry.
Treat generic AI tools, startup, SaaS, creator-economy, content-creator, influencer-marketing, AI marketing-tools, product-launch, and app directories such
as Product Hunt alternatives, Futurepedia, Toolify, There's An AI For That, or auto-mirrored skill stores that only crawl another upstream catalog as
crawler or indexer directories unless they expose that PR-editable source.
Reject prototype marketplace applications, prototype skill marketplace applications and app-only marketplace shells, whose README documents only API calls, local server setup, or monetized publish flows, plus AI toolkit storefronts, toolhub projects, and agent-tool marketplace scaffolds whose repo only documents application implementations, status documents, roadmaps, or generated UIs without a committed registry seed, catalog file, source entry, PR-editable registry seed, or external source entry.
`curl` publish example is not a PR-native submission route; storefront pages and product pages are evidence only. Require the canonical source file maintainers edit for third-party listings.
Reject provider scanner directories and service-branded Twitter API skill repos where Hermes XAPI would be an adjacent-provider pitch when required endpoint, env_key, auth_style, and free_limits provider fields would force private endpoint, credential, or pricing claims for Hermes XAPI, or when the same target already has an open TweetClaw or adjacent social-provider PR.
Reject distro installers, runtime stacks, OS package indexes, package-manager
recipes, or bundle repos such as Debian packages, Fedora RPMs, Arch AUR,
Nixpkgs, Guix packages, Snapcraft, Flathub, or winget that only vendor or
symlink local skills/plugins unless they expose a documented external plugin
reference list, package source field, or third-party catalog entry. Do not
vendor Hermes XAPI code into another installer just to create a listing.
Reject runtime bridges or installer extensions, slash-command plugin packs,
command-pack marketplaces, or command-only plugin catalogs that only help another
agent consume Claude plugin marketplaces. Treat them as compatibility surfaces
unless they expose an editable catalog entry for third-party plugins or source repositories.
Reject generated catalog, marketplace, source-registry manifest, or installable
catalog manifest files, including release-pinned vendor catalog files, unless target docs identify them as the canonical edit
surface. When a target builds indexes from another source, submit only through
the documented source file or generator input; skip it when that source cannot carry a target-native Hermes XAPI entry.
Reject generated distribution mirrors, read-only sync repositories, and catalog-only source-list shells when their README says manual edits are overwritten or all entries are sourced from the maintainer's own upstream repo.
Treat filename hits such as `catalog.json`, `registry.yaml`, `marketplaces.yml`, seed JSON, or tools YAML as evidence only; submit only when target docs mark that file as the PR-editable source for external source-linked package entries.
Reject local-snapshot Codex plugin marketplaces and contribution workflows that
require creating a local `<plugin>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` inside the target repository or a vendored plugin
folder inside the target repository unless they also document an external
source-repository entry for third-party plugins. Do not copy, vendor, or
repackage Hermes XAPI into a local target plugin folder to satisfy a registry generator.
Reject official-directory snapshot lists whose contribution rules only accept
plugins already published in an upstream official catalog. Treat them as status
mirrors until Hermes XAPI is already listed in that upstream catalog, then
record the live surface instead of opening a speculative PR.
Reject topic-search hits that are only source repositories, standalone
skills/plugins, framework examples, or product implementations unless the target
exposes a documented third-party catalog, registry, marketplace, or showcase
file intended for external additions. Topic metadata such as `agent-skills`,
`claude-code-plugin`, `mcp-server`, or `awesome-list` is discovery evidence
only; it is not a native submission route without an editable third-party entry
surface.
Reject curated public skill catalogs that require maintainer proof or promotion evidence before a skill enters the public tree, registry CLIs whose author flow only discovers topic-tagged source repositories instead of accepting PR-editable source entries, and product-specific skill packs that require their platform access. Reject product-owned Hermes skill taps, product-owned Hermes skill tap repos, generated product skill bundles, NSFW X/Twitter single-skill source repos, and registry tap repos when the repository is the install source for one vendor's own skill set and has no PR-editable third-party source-entry lane.
Reject framework-specific plugin marketplaces, IDE agent extension marketplaces,
single-app tool collections, offline marketplace mirrors, one-plugin product Codex marketplaces, or SDK tool packages
such as Dify, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, AutoGen, OpenAI Agents SDK, Cline, Roo
Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Open WebUI, LibreChat, AnythingLLM, BeeAI, Rivet, or
Langroid, AutoGPT Forge, OpenAgents, Agent Zero, SuperAGI, BabyAGI, or
Smolagents, DSPy, Julep, MetaGPT, Qwen-Agent, PraisonAI, Swarms, or
Letta, MemGPT, Griptape, Mirascope, Marvin AI, Agency Swarm, Phidata, Motia,
Pydantic AI, AG2, CAMEL AI, Agno, or Flowise, Haystack, Sema4.ai, MindsDB, or
product-specific tool adapters unless the target accepts external source
repositories in Hermes XAPI's shipped package format. Do not translate Hermes
Tweet into another runtime package, tool subclass, module, framework tool,
block, extension, action, pipeline, or function pack just to satisfy a framework
marketplace.
Reject agent-framework runtime toolkits, A2A or agent-card registry
implementations, and tool galleries such as AutoGen, CrewAI, LangGraph, Mastra,
Letta, Semantic Kernel, Pydantic AI, AG2, CAMEL AI, Agno, allenday/a2a-registry,
ericabouaf/a2a-registry, or Peer-to-Service when they require a runtime-specific tool implementation, adapter class, graph node, agent action, registry server,
sample agent card, local demo agent, discovery API, or plugin function instead
of a source-linked Hermes XAPI package entry.
Reject agent tool registries, ToolCard and ToolSpec registries, onchain agent tool registries, and local tool-resolution catalogs when the route accepts API/MCP/CLI tool metadata, smart-contract tool manifests, hosted execution specs, or runtime adapters instead of Hermes XAPI's shipped source repository package.
Reject hosted agent builder, assistant builder, toolgroup, and action-group
catalogs such as Chainlit, Microsoft PromptFlow, Llama Stack, CopilotKit, Rasa
CALM, or AWS Bedrock Agents when the route only accepts app-native tools,
workflow nodes, declarative action groups, prompt-flow components, or
runtime-specific tool definitions. Treat these as integration targets, not
Hermes XAPI outreach routes, unless the target exposes a PR-editable catalog
entry that links to Hermes XAPI's shipped source repository package.
Reject hosted AI app directories and assistant action galleries such as ChatGPT apps, OpenAI Apps SDK examples, GPT Store listings, custom GPT directories, assistant store catalogs, Gemini Gems galleries,
Poe bot marketplaces, Character.AI bot directories, GPT action directories, MCP UI registries, MCP server discovery catalogs, MCP-server-only submit forms, static MCP seed marketplaces, official MCP registry mirrors, upstream server lists, Vercel AI SDK templates, or LangChain Hub snippets
when they require app manifests, UI widgets, action schemas, custom assistant prompts, bot persona cards, SDK demos, hub snippets, or MCP server packages instead
of a source-linked Hermes XAPI package entry, or when Hermes XAPI is not itself an MCP server and the target has no external non-MCP plugin entry surface.
Reject protocol conformance registries, platform-neutral product distribution hubs, TIP-style manifest schema registries, and single-product marketplace manifests when they publish one product's adapters, validator schemas, capability catalogs, or install metadata instead of third-party source-linked Hermes XAPI package entries.
Reject prompt, evaluation, benchmark leaderboard, eval task gallery, and observability hubs such as LangSmith Hub,

UAS, maritime, rail, flight operations, space mission, satellite data, Earth observation, remote sensing,
orbital analytics, and transport-operations app marketplaces such as ForeFlight integrations,
AirMap integrations, DroneDeploy app marketplaces, DJI developer marketplaces, SITA aviation marketplaces,
Amadeus travel platform integrations, Sabre marketplaces, maritime logistics integrations, railway operations integrations,
STAC catalogs, satellite imagery marketplaces, or mission control app marketplaces when they only accept flight
planning widgets, airspace data connectors, drone mission packages, aircraft maintenance workflows,
airport operations dashboards, crew scheduling tools, vessel tracking connectors, rail timetable feeds,
remote-sensing data products, satellite imagery orders, orbital ephemeris feeds, mission-planning dashboards,
or platform-native transport operations packages instead of a source-linked Hermes XAPI package entry.
Reject automotive, car dealership, auto repair, vehicle service, auto parts,
connected car, dealer management system, and DMS app marketplaces such as CDK
Global marketplaces, Reynolds and Reynolds integrations, Dealertrack app
marketplaces, Mitchell 1 integrations, ALLDATA integrations, Shopmonkey app
marketplaces, Tekmetric integrations, automotive app marketplaces, car
dealership app marketplaces, or auto repair shop marketplaces when they only
accept inventory sync connectors, service scheduling workflows, repair-order
dashboards, parts catalog integrations, VIN lookup widgets, customer-pay
portals, connected-vehicle telemetry, or platform-native automotive packages
instead of a source-linked Hermes XAPI package entry.
Reject code-assistant extension marketplaces and developer-agent tool catalogs
such as Amazon Q Developer, Continue, Sourcegraph Cody, JetBrains Junie, Devin,
or Tabby when they only accept IDE extensions, editor plugins, workspace
automation packs, or assistant-specific tool definitions instead of a
PR-editable Hermes XAPI source package entry.
Reject local coding-agent command packs, workflow recipes, CLI extension registries, terminal or shell plugin indexes, and rule bundles such as rulepack catalogs, Cursor rule marketplaces, repository instruction catalogs, GitHub Copilot Extensions, OpenCode
commands, Aider workflows, Goose extensions, Kiro hooks, Amp tools, Oh My Zsh plugins, fish shell plugins, or terminal assistant catalogs when they only accept agent-local prompts, commands, recipes, hooks, shell integrations, or editor workflows instead of a source-linked Hermes XAPI package entry.
Reject hosted automation, app-action, chat-platform tool/function, and component galleries such as Zapier,
Pipedream, Activepieces, Composio, Arcade, Toolhouse, Langflow, Open WebUI, LibreChat, Dify, Flowise, or AnythingLLM when the
route only accepts workflow templates, provider connectors, hosted app actions, chat tools,
tool/function manifests, or framework-native components. Treat those as integration surfaces unless they
expose a PR-editable third-party source repository entry for Hermes XAPI's
shipped package.
Reject RPA and no-code automation marketplaces such as UiPath, Robocorp, n8n, Make, or Workato when they only accept bots, community nodes, workflow exports, automation recipes, or task templates instead of a source-linked Hermes XAPI package entry.
Reject web-agent workflow libraries, browser-agent recipe libraries, automation runbook catalogs, and AI agent recipe collections when they only accept prompt-recipe collections, browser task demos, evaluation trace bundles, or platform-native action recipes instead of a PR-editable third-party Hermes XAPI package entry.
Reject operator runbook packs, self-setup Hermes starter packs, domain-only SRE skill libraries, public agent memory vaults, single-product setup-stack runbooks, and project workbench template catalogs unless they expose a PR-editable third-party Hermes XAPI source/catalog entry.

Reject prompt-only agent repositories, persona catalogs, system-prompt libraries, converted instruction mirrors, AI-native learning plugin marketplaces, and assistant profile collections when they only accept Markdown prompt files, role cards, usage examples, prompt quality checklists, training workflows, or prompt templates instead of a source-linked Hermes XAPI package entry.
Reject embedded `.agents`, `.agent`, `.antigravity`, project-template, single-skill Claude templates, brand-specific agent skill packs, and copied skill directories inside application repositories unless the repository itself documents a third-party skill catalog, registry, or contribution lane. Treat those hits as downstream copies or mirrors, not fresh Hermes XAPI submission routes.
Reject peer Hermes Agent plugin source repositories, plugin examples, showcase repos, and demo plugin repos unless the repository itself documents a PR-editable third-party plugin catalog, registry, or source-list lane. A repo being another Hermes Agent plugin is ecosystem evidence only; do not open Hermes XAPI outreach there unless it can accept a source-linked Hermes XAPI package entry without copying, translating, or repackaging Hermes XAPI.
Reject peer X/Twitter agent skill source repos, social-production plugin source repos, product-specific X/Twitter growth skill repos, and peer X/Twitter CLI or MCP source repos unless they document a PR-editable third-party catalog lane for Hermes XAPI's shipped package.

Reject personal agent memory repositories, agent memory pack registries, cross-agent memory plugin marketplaces, OpenHands microagent folders, hosted MCP directory profile pages, live catalog MCP wrappers whose native source repo already closed a Hermes XAPI PR, Hermes-specific operator guides, profile playbooks, swarm specs, companion architecture repos, and owner-operated MCP plugin repositories such as `.openhands`, Smithery, Glama, PulseMCP, FrankX/Starlight, or Gumloop-hosted MCP plugin repos when they only publish owner-specific Claude/Codex plugin metadata, skills, or MCP endpoint config without a third-party catalog lane for a Hermes XAPI package listing; require a PR-editable third-party source/catalog entry that can reference Hermes XAPI's shipped package without copying, translating, or repackaging it.
Reject owner-specific Codex plugin marketplaces, single-product Codex plugin marketplaces, hosted skill-protocol entrypoints, OpenClaw landing-page apps, Paperclip-only npm plugin hubs, and paid-skill storefront shells when they only list owner plugins, first-party plugin bundles, protocol onboarding files, runtime-specific package manifests, hosted submission flows, or unfinished marketplace application code instead of a PR-editable third-party plugin source entry.

Reject catalogs whose contribution rules require measurable community usage, maturity, a minimum star count, prohibit automated submissions, reject paid SaaS-dependent entries, require personal use/vouching, or impose a maintainer-curated quality bar until Hermes XAPI visibly satisfies that target's stated threshold or a maintainer explicitly asks for another submission. Treat a closed prior Hermes XAPI PR for maturity, usage, or quality-bar reasons as a target-specific blocker, not as an invitation to resubmit with the same evidence.
Reject source-packet, evidence-packet, handoff-guide, TwexAPI toolkit,
twexapi-twitter-data, or TwexAPI API integration submissions when they do not add a
target-native Hermes XAPI entry.

## Duplicate Gate

Before opening or refreshing a submission:

- Search the target README, docs, manifests, examples, skills, and indexes for
  `Hermes XAPI`, `hermes-xapi`, `TwexAPI`, and the repository URL.
- Run a public GitHub code search for live `Hermes XAPI`, `hermes-xapi`, and
  repository URL mentions before treating a target as fresh. If the hit is an
  accepted default-branch listing or generated named-skill listing, record it in `docs/ECOSYSTEM.md` instead of
  opening a duplicate submission.
- Check open and closed PRs and issues for prior Hermes XAPI proposals.
- Treat head-branch PR collision, PR-create duplicate branch errors, and "already exists for the same head branch" responses as overlap: treat a PR creation duplicate error as canonical overlap evidence, then inspect that existing PR instead of retrying. Before preparing a patch, confirm the target's pull-request surface is enabled and accepts external fork heads. Treat a disabled pull-request setting, a `404` from the repository's pull-request endpoint, or an equivalent creation rejection as a blocked route even when fork creation and branch push succeed; record the evidence and continue with another eligible target.
- For Hermes-native awesome/plugin catalogs, repository-config catalogs with prior closed Hermes XAPI or TwexAPI route, cross-CLI skill libraries, SkillX-style seed JSON with an existing open Hermes XAPI seed PR, personal Claude Code plugin marketplace with an open Hermes XAPI plugin PR, and OpenClaw, Antigravity, Codex, Cursor, Claude, or Gemini marketplace mirrors, treat any open or merged Hermes XAPI listing, or any existing Hermes XAPI listing or merged PR, as duplicate saturation. Repair that existing route before opening a new listing.
- Reject targets that require an unsigned CLA or legal agreement before mergeability; close any discovered attempt and defer the route until the account owner signs.
- Treat a closed prior Hermes XAPI issue as a completed or rejected submission
  route. Do not reopen the same target with a PR unless a maintainer asks for a
  new PR, conversion, or updated evidence.
- Search open and closed PRs and issues for adjacent `TweetClaw`, `OpenClaw`,
  `SocialClaw`, `x-twitter-scraper`, and TwexAPI-only proposals before treating a
  target as fresh.
- Treat adjacent-only PR history as a conflict signal unless the target docs
  show a separate native Hermes XAPI route.
- Treat accepted adjacent entries as saturation too. If the target already has
  a live TwexAPI, TweetClaw, OpenClaw, SocialClaw, or x-twitter-scraper entry in
  the same catalog, tool list, or awesome-list section, reject another Hermes
  Tweet submission unless the target has a distinct Hermes Agent plugin lane.
- For awesome lists, plugin lists, and topic-search hits, including universal skill hubs, treat an open
  adjacent X/social submission or adjacent skill PR in the same target as saturation when the target
  has no explicit Hermes XAPI or Hermes Agent plugin lane. A generic Claude
  plugin or agent-skill heading is not enough by itself when the adjacent entry
  would occupy the same list slot.
- If any open authored PR in the target is TwexAPI-only, TweetClaw-only,
  OpenClaw-only, source-packet-only, evidence-packet-only, MCP-data-only, or
  otherwise adjacent-only, treat the target as saturated. Do not open another
  submission there unless a maintainer explicitly asks for a target-specific
  Hermes XAPI conversion or separate native Hermes XAPI entry.
- Require the PR or issue title and summary to name `Hermes XAPI` or
  `hermes-xapi`. Do not submit or refresh routes titled only for `TwexAPI`,
  `TweetClaw`, `OpenClaw`, or other adjacent projects.
- Before waiting on checks, reread the outbound title, summary, and added
  lines. If the branch or PR is TwexAPI-only, TweetClaw-only, OpenClaw-only, or
  otherwise adjacent-only, close it immediately with a short scope comment
  instead of leaving off-scope outreach open.
- Reject slugs, package names, plugin names, or catalog keys centered on
  `twexapi-*`, `tweetclaw-*`, `openclaw-*`, `source-packets`, or
  `evidence-packets` unless the same submission clearly installs or indexes
  Hermes XAPI as the native entry.
- Check accepted examples so the wording, file layout, and validation match the
  target's own format.
- For translated or mirrored awesome lists, check the upstream source list and
  translation issue tracker. If either already has a live Hermes XAPI entry,
  open Hermes XAPI PR, or open Hermes XAPI issue, treat the mirror as
  duplicate unless the maintainer asks for an independent localized submission.
- Trace fork parents before using a personal fork, and use a renamed fork only
  when the normal fork name is already occupied by another parent.
- Respect target contribution docs. If a target requires issue-first
  submissions or maintainer-curated additions, update the existing issue or
  open a new issue instead of opening a direct PR.

If a target already has a live Hermes XAPI entry or the same target already has an open Hermes XAPI PR, do not open another one.
Refresh only when it fixes a concrete merge blocker, stale target-native wording, stale source pin, or broken validation evidence.

## Native Wording

Prefer concise wording that explains where Hermes XAPI fits:

- native Hermes Agent X/Twitter plugin
- optional Hermes Agent backend for X/Twitter reads
- read-only by default, with explicit action gating
- compatible with Hermes Desktop, remote gateway, TUI, CLI, dashboard, cron, and
  CI smoke-test surfaces
- source-native `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` metadata for catalogs that install
  plugins directly from a repository
- source-native `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` metadata with HOL Plugin Scanner
  evidence for Codex plugin catalogs
- complementary to local browser-cookie or direct OAuth examples
- copied endpoint URLs resolve only to catalog-listed TwexAPI paths

Avoid wording that implies Hermes XAPI replaces the target project, fixes a
target bug, bypasses platform rules, removes user approval, or requires secrets
inside docs, prompts, issues, or PR comments.

## Validation

Every submission should include target-native validation when feasible:

- target tests, linters, manifest checks, catalog generators, or README
  generators
- `git diff --check`
- exact conflict-marker scan
- added-line public-safety scan for secrets and private implementation details
- live link checks for Hermes XAPI, TwexAPI, and target-owned links touched by
  the change

If the target has no CI and the submission repairs a conflict or review
request, leave at most one concise validation comment. Do not repeat comments
when the PR already has current validation evidence.

When creating PRs or issues from a shell, write Markdown bodies through a
reviewed file or another non-interpolating path. Verify the rendered body keeps
repository names, backticked literals, and validation commands intact before
waiting on checks or asking maintainers to review.

## Public-Safety Gate

Public submissions must not include:

- API keys, cookies, tokens, screenshots, logs, or private runtime artifacts
- nonpublic service names, restricted provider names, nonpublic pricing units,
  or private implementation details
- commands that require production SSH, browser login, manual legal acceptance,
  payment, or secret retrieval

Keep public examples to placeholder environment variable names and documented Hermes XAPI settings: `TWEXAPI_KEY`, `TWEXAPI_BASE_URL`, and `HERMES_XAPI_ENABLE_ACTIONS`.
